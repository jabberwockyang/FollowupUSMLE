His wife reports that the patient “has not been himself” since their son was stillborn 6 months ago. She says that during the past month, he hardly has slept and has not showered or shaved; he sits in the dark and refuses to eat. He began fluoxetine therapy 3 months ago, but his symptoms have continued to worsen. He appears disheveled. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 52 kg (115 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m2. His pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. When asked about his mood, he says, “I don’t know.” He has a tearful affect. He responds to most questions with one- word answers in a soft voice. He says he hears a voice telling him that he is a failure and says he wants to join his son in heaven. He refuses to answer questions about suicide. After removing all firearms from the patient’s house and admitting him to a psychiatric facility, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?    \n\n\nA. Electroconvulsive therapy\nB. Imipramine therapy\nC. Mirtazapine therapy\nD. Sertraline therapy\nE. Transcranial magnetic stimulation"

The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? \n\n\nA. Decrease the dose of metoprolol\nB. Increase the dose of prednisone\nC. Obtain serum vitamin D concentration\nD. Order a transthoracic echocardiography"

His medical chart shows that he had one other uncomplicated hospital admission at age 4 years for a vaso-occlusive crisis with lower extremity bone pain. Vital signs today are temperature 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 115/60 mm Hg. The patient is uncomfortable but does not appear toxic. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border. Spleen is not palpated. There is considerable tenderness over the L1–L3 region of the back without fluctuation. There is diffuse pain in both thighs without localization, but range of motion is normal.\n\nWhich of the following studies is most likely to establish the diagnosis at this time?\n\n\nA. Blood culture\nB. CT scan of the spine\nC. MRI of the lumbar spine\nD. Ultrasonography of the spine\nE. X-ray of the spine"
